I'm a PhD student at MIT, studying AI, machine learning, and human intelligence. My research focus is program synthesis: I build systems that write code. My advisers are [Josh Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Armando Solar-Lezama](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/).

My publications can be found [here]({% link _pages/publications.md %}). 

I recieved a BA in physics at Harvard.

**News:**  
- Our paper [Learning to Infer Program Sketches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06349.pdf) was accepted to ICML 2019
