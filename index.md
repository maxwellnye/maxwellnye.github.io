I'm a PhD student at MIT, studying AI, machine learning, and human intelligence.

My research focus is program learning. Specifically, I work on the idea that learning programs from data could provide a way to develop machines which possess more human-like intelligence. My research has two aims:  
1. Developing novel methods for synthesizing programs, combining deep learning and symbolic techniques.  
2. Applying program synthesis to build human-like AI models to solve concept learning and reasoning tasks.  

My advisors are [Josh Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Armando Solar-Lezama](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/). I also work with [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) (NYU/Facebook AI) on few-shot learning via program synthesis.  

I've spent time as an intern at Facebook AI Research. Before MIT, I received a BA in physics from Harvard.
