I'm a PhD student at MIT, studying AI, machine learning, and human intelligence. My research focus is program synthesis: I build systems that write code. My advisers are [Josh Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Armando Solar-Lezama](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/). Before MIT, I received a BA in physics from Harvard.


My publications can be found [here]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).
